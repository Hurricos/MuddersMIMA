Add hiside driver for brake lights.
This will need to source power from C506 WHT/BLU, which is hot at all times and ONLY powers the PDU fan.  Need to see how much current the PDU fan pulls at high speed.  Brake lights pull about 5 amps.

Possible high-side drivers include:
497-15993-1-ND
846-BV1HAL45EFJ-E2CT-ND
BTS50301EJAXUMA1CT-ND
