silkscreen:
Add diode/LED polarity markings

+12V color coding is wrong:
Existing: PNK/BLU
Correct: BLK/YEL

...

Add which seat middle connector each wire comes from:
-top connector is gray, C506
-bottom connector is blue, C505
Proposed silkscreen text:
A: MA2 | BLK/YEL(BLU22) (note: this is the third BLK/YEL wire in this harness, but only one on blue connector).
B: MA1 | RED/YEL(BLU01)
C: CMD | BLU/BLK(BLU04)
D: GND | BRN/YEL(BLU20)
E: 12K | BLK/YEL(GRY07) (note: C506 has QTY2 BLK/YEL wires.  Both are +12V.  Use either one.)
F: NEP | BLU/BLU(GRY02)
G: VSS | BLU/WHT(GRY08)
H: 12A | WHT/BLU(GRY03) (note: not on RevA)

For easier wiring, change connector positions as follows:
A: MA2 | BLK/YEL(BLU22) (note: this is the third BLK/YEL wire in this harness, but only one on blue connector).
D: GND | BRN/YEL(BLU20)
H: 12A | WHT/BLU(GRY09) (note: not on RevA)(note: C506 has QTY2 WHT/BLU wires.  Use thick one!)
G: VSS | BLU/WHT(GRY08)
E: 12K | BLK/YEL(GRY07) (note: C506 has QTY2 BLK/YEL wires.  Both are +12V.  Use either one.)
C: CMD | BLU/BLK(BLU04)
F: NEP | BLU/BLU(GRY02)
B: MA1 | RED/YEL(BLU01)


FYI: Pin1 is driver-side top

Should include QTY2 "+12V KEYON" labels that user installs on that wire before cutting it.
