silkscreen:
Add diode/LED polarity markings

+12V color coding is wrong:
Existing: PNK/BLU
Correct: BLK/YEL

...

Add which seat middle connector each wire comes from:
-top connector is gray, C506
-bottom connector is blue, C505
Proposed silkscreen text:
MA2 | BLK/YEL(BLU22) (note: this is the third BLK/YEL wire in this harness, but only one on blue connector).
MA1 | RED/YEL(BLU01)
CMD | BLU/BLK(BLU04)
GND | BRN/YEL(BLU20)
12V | BLK/YEL(GRY07) (note: C506 has QTY2 BLK/YEL wires.  Both are +12V.  Use either one.)
NEP | BLU/BLU(GRY02)
VSS | BLU/WHT(GRY08)

FYI: Pin1 is driver-side top

Should include QTY2 "+12V KEYON" labels that user installs on that wire before cutting it.
