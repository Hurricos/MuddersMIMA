R30 & R31 cause voltage to sag when CMOS flips
Add more capacitance in parallel to C12 & C13... or lower resistance on R30 & R31... or both.

Troubleshooting: Adding 1 uF capacitor makes behavior better... but PWM duty cycle is still off slightly.

Depop C8 & C9 to make duty cycle closer to correct value.

Change R24 & R25 to 100 Ohms

Solution:
Partially implemented above, and changed 20 Ohm resistors to ferrites.
